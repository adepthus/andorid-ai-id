**A conceptual quiet tribute to decentralized systems and AI, inspired by my early connections with pioneers in AI and Bitcoin.**

## About

I created `andorid-ai-id` back in April 2011, driven by my deep fascination with artificial intelligence and decentralized tech. It’s a conceptual project that came to life after a meaningful conversation I had with Hal Finney, a cryptography pioneer and one of Bitcoin’s earliest adopters, on Twitter (now X) on April 4–5, 2011. The idea was to imagine a platform that could stream data live to AI software on Android devices, rooted in the same trust and independence that defined Bitcoin’s early days.

This repository also marks a personal milestone: my registration of the SkypeID **BITCOIN** at the turn of **2004/2005**—years before Bitcoin even existed. It was a nod to the peer-to-peer spirit I admired in platforms like Skype, which later became a cornerstone of Bitcoin’s philosophy. Hal Finney knew about this registration, which gave our conversation a special historical weight. My interest in AI started even earlier, through my connection with Richard S. Wallace, the creator of AIML, in the botmasters community, where I went by the pseudonym adepthus. This project isn’t functional code—it’s more of a reflection of my curiosity about AI, cryptography, and how they can build trust in digital spaces.

I’m a self-described **Human Prompt Engineer**—not a coder, but someone who loves exploring ideas like Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and AIML. I’ve been intrigued by concepts like gradient descent long before they became mainstream, and I dream of systems that can learn and operate in a decentralized, trust-based world.

## Purpose

This repository is a personal archive of my connections to the early AI and Bitcoin communities. It’s not a working project but a space to share the ideas that came from my interactions with pioneers like Richard S. Wallace, Hal Finney, and Dave Kleiman, whom I reached out to twice—once via video call in May 2011 and again on April 16, 2013. I’m sharing this with humility, confident in the truth of my story, and I welcome thoughtful dialogue.

## Note on Historical Records

The SkypeID **BITCOIN**, which I registered at the turn of **2004/2005**, and my Twitter conversation with Hal Finney mean a lot to me, both personally and historically. I still have a one-time login token that was sent to my tenbit.pl email for a password reset, along with two or three passwords I set for the account back then. I also remember the registration details (tied to my identity and a company I registered in 2000) and have clear memories of my interactions, including those with Dave Kleiman. I’m working to recover access to these assets and would appreciate support from relevant platforms to verify and retrieve these records, which are a small but meaningful part of the early AI and Bitcoin story.

## About Me

Let me be clear: I am **not Satoshi Nakamoto**, and I’ve never sought to profit from Bitcoin. My journey is all about curiosity and principles, inspired by pioneers like Richard S. Wallace, Hal Finney, and Dave Kleiman, to whom I owe so much gratitude. I live modestly by choice and see myself as a **Human Prompt Engineer**, exploring the intersection of AI and decentralization. My passion for systems like CBR and AIML reflects my lifelong interest in tech that learns and thrives in a trust-driven world.

## Why andorid-ai-id?

I named this repository "andorid-ai-id"  on purpose, with a little misspelling that reminds me of the Bitcoin community’s „HODL” meme. I’m not a coder, so I wanted to spark curiosity and encourage someone else to take the idea further—maybe even using the proper name, "android-ai-id". It’s the same way I approached Bitcoin: I shared the idea to inspire others to build on it, then stepped back to let it grow on its own. I hoped this name would do the same for someone out there.

## Contributing

This repository is more of a historical and conceptual piece. I’d love to hear respectful feedback or ideas about the intersection of AI and decentralization.



*Dedicated to Richard S. Wallace, Hal Finney, Dave Kleiman, and the pioneers of AI and Bitcoin, whose vision continues to inspire.*
