ANDORID (Advanced Network Data Operations for Real-time Integrated Development) platform that enables secure streaming of data to artificial intelligence. 

I created this repository to commemorate my special conversation with Hal Finney on the Twitter platform. April 4/5, 2011.

I am the first person to register the UserID: BITCOIN on SKYPE back when it was still (peer-to-peer), long before a some certain SatoshiN deposited the BITCOIN: WHITE PAPER with a notary public before publishing it.

Satoshi Nakamoto is the author of BITCOIN: Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System and he’s the only one to own the keys to Genesis and 1 blocks, as well as the PGP private key recognized by developers.

I am not that person.

Keep in mind the first principle of BITCOIN SYSTEM: Singing is a Key.

Bitcoin has never been any source of income or profit to me.

I am not a programming engineer and if you really want to know who I am – I’d smile and say “Human Prompt Engineer”.

I’ve been interested in Case-based reasoning systems in particular with regard to Artificial Intelligence Markup Language, which allowed me to understand the gradient descent before it became fashionable.
